Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using Deep Learning
This project is aimed at developing a deep learning model for detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR) from retinal fundus images. Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes and can cause blindness if not detected and treated early. The deep learning model is trained on a large dataset of retinal fundus images and can accurately classify images into one of five DR severity levels.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the EyePACS dataset, which contains over 100,000 retinal fundus images labeled with DR severity levels. The images are preprocessed and resized to 224x224 pixels before being fed into the deep learning model.

Model
The deep learning model used in this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the AlexNet architecture. The model is trained on the EyePACS dataset using transfer learning with pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset.
